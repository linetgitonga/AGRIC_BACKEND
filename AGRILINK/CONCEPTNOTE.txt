ðŸ“„ Concept Note: AgriLink: Intelligent Crop Recommendation & Farmer Empowerment Platform
1. Introduction
Agriculture remains the backbone of many economies, especially in developing regions. However, farmers often struggle to determine the best crops to grow based on their soil and climatic conditions. Additionally, challenges in accessing markets, buyers, and modern agricultural knowledge further affect productivity and incomes.
AgriLink is a proposed intelligent, data-driven platform that aims to recommend suitable crops, connect farmers directly to buyers, provide a vibrant online marketplace, facilitate community-driven knowledge sharing, and offer a learning portal for continuous farmer education.

2. Problem Statement
Farmers lack personalized recommendations based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH levels, rainfall, and temperature.

Market access is fragmented, with many farmers relying on middlemen.

There is a gap in agricultural education, especially in modern, sustainable practices.

Farmers have few online communities where they can exchange ideas, troubleshoot issues, and collaborate.

3. Objectives
Provide farmers with intelligent crop recommendations based on local soil and environmental data.

Facilitate direct connections between farmers and buyers (including contract farming).

Establish an online marketplace for selling excess produce.

Create community forums for farmer-to-farmer support.

Launch a learning portal to provide agricultural resources, courses, and expert talks.

4. System Components
